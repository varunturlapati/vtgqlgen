InfraDB Server model
Server {
  ID (this is going to be a bit weird to implement, what will own the idea of ID?)
  HostName (InfraDB preferred, fallback to Netbox)
  Environment (InfraDB logical environment)
  SuperFarm (InfraDB)
  ServerGroup (InfraDB)
  RackNumber (Netbox)
  Pod (Our netbox might have this info, or there might need to be some business logic to determine that)
  DataCenter (Might want to prefer netbox when we can, but InfraDB will have C3PO resources like AWS)
  IPAddresses (v4, v6, public, and private: Netbox and InfraDB will have this knowledge)
}
